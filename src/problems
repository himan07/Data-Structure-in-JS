1. **Two Sum**
   - **Problem:** Given an array of integers and a target value, find two numbers in the array that add up to the target value and return their indices.
   - **Example:** Input: `[2, 7, 11, 15]`, Target: `9`. Output: `[0, 1]` (since `2 + 7 = 9`).

2. **Reverse an Array**
   - **Problem:** Reverse the elements of an array in place.
   - **Example:** Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`. Output: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.

3. **Find the Missing Number**
   - **Problem:** Given an array containing `n` distinct numbers taken from `0, 1, 2, ..., n`, find the one that is missing.
   - **Example:** Input: `[3, 0, 1]`. Output: `2`.

4. **Move Zeros**
   - **Problem:** Given an array, move all zeros to the end without changing the order of non-zero elements.
   - **Example:** Input: `[0, 1, 0, 3, 12]`. Output: `[1, 3, 12, 0, 0]`.

5. **Rotate Array**

   - **Example:** Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `k = 3`. Output: `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

6. **Find the Duplicates**
   - **Problem:** Given an array of integers where each value is between `1` and `n` (inclusive) where `n` is the length of the array, find all duplicates.
   - **Example:** Input: `[4, 3, 2, 7, 8, 2, 1, 7]`. Output: `[2, 7]`.

7. **Find the Maximum Product of Two Integers**
   - **Problem:** Find the maximum product of two integers in an array.
   - **Example:** Input: `[1, 10, -5, 3, 2]`. Output: `30` (from `10 * 3`).

8. **Longest Consecutive Sequence**
   - **Problem:** Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
   - **Example:** Input: `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`. Output: `4` (for sequence `[1, 2, 3, 4]`).

9. **Find the Intersection of Two Arrays**
   - **Problem:** Given two arrays, find their intersection.
   - **Example:** Input: `[1, 2, 2, 1]` and `[2, 2]`. Output: `[2, 2]`.

    - **Problem:** Find the `kth` largest element in an unsorted array.
    - **Example:** Input: `[3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]`, `k = 2`. Output: `5`.

11. **Product of Array Except Self**
    - **Problem:** Given an array, return an array where each element is the product of all other elements in the original array except itself.
    - **Example:** Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Output: `[24, 12, 8, 6]`.

12. **Subarray with Given Sum**
    - **Problem:** Given an array and a target sum, find a contiguous subarray that sums to the target.
    - **Example:** Input: `[1, 2, 3, 7, 5]`, Target: `12`. Output: `[2, 3, 7]`.

13. **Find the Peak Element**
